        <i>Wool-gatherers</i>
        <br />
        An installation <br /><br />

        <i>Untitled</i><br />
        Float glass, window safety decal, 330 x 100 x 5 mm <br /><br />

        A thick piece of glass floats on the wall. Its bottom is straight and
        its top is a sloping line. An image is fixed to the front surface
        created by four circles overlapping one another. The edges of the glass
        are an in-between of blue and green. The edges accentuate the greenness
        of the material. <br /><br />

        <i>Divers</i><br />
        Copper plate etching on paper, 225 x 280 mm <br /><br />

        A white piece of paper is hung on the wall with an image that has been
        printed twice. The image is a portrait-orientated etching of a diver.
        The lighter colour image sits diagonally higher than the bluer image.
        The diver’s body is extended by the two prints. The diver is diving down
        toward the ground. <br /><br />

        <i>Untitled</i><br />
        Found object, drawing pin, 450 x 330 mm <br /><br />

        A piece of black foam hangs slightly above a shelf. It is
        landscape-orientated. It has a small black drawing pin in the top right
        hand corner. The surface is covered with some white speckles. Most are
        collected in the bottom left hand corner running almost halfway. There
        is a cloudy liquid blotch next to this. A long skinny white line shoots
        up toward the top. Some thin dust covers most of the surface.
        <br /><br />

        <i>Untitled (Shelf)</i><br />
        Blackbutt timber, glow in the dark epoxy resin, 1720 x 105 x 30 mm
        <br /><br />

        A shelf runs along the wall. It is fixed at five points; long ovals
        recede into the pink hardwood. They are positioned evenly along the
        underneath which returns to the wall at an angle. The front of the shelf
        comes to a small face. The grain of the timber is filled with a
        phosphorescent resin. Its glow can been seen in the dark or if one’s
        hand is cupped on the surface and peered though. The right end of the
        shelf supports a relationship between an object and an image.
        <br /><br />

        <i>Untitled</i><br />
        Shell, 160 x 130 x 60 mm <br /><br />

        A shell lazes atop the shelf, against a piece of cardboard. It has a
        collection of small ridges and a point on one side and a rounder
        oscillating edge on the other. Some of the ridges of the shell have been
        sharpened. This edge faces outward toward the roof, its form echoes an
        image of a small cloud that sits to the right of it. There is a small
        flicker of pink where the shell comes to a point. Dust has collected on
        the inside. <br /><br />

        <i>Untitled (Self portrait as a magician)</i><br />
        Cardboard, acrylic, silkscreen image, 400 x 700 mm <br /><br />

        An irregular-shaped piece of cardboard stands upright. Its shortest end
        is the bottom. The left edge of the cardboard has a tear about nine
        tenths up. Just below there is a curl left over from the material that
        used to be attached. An image of a magician performing magic is repeated
        over the surface, mostly in the middle and toward the bottom. The image
        is flipped from just above the centre, down. The light white and greyish
        colour of the image varies in tone. Some splotches of red sit at the
        very back of the image around the centre. There is a smudge of white
        paint near the top left corner. <br /><br />

        <i>Untitled</i><br />
        Sticker, 45 x 80 mm <br /><br />

        A metallic blue sticker is adhered to the bottom left corner of a
        window. The image is of a decorative motif, a pictorial flourish. It has
        a clear border that runs around the image.
